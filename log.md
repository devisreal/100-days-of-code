# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Starting out with 100 Days of code.

**Thoughts:** Today marks the first day of the challenge and I so hope to see it to the end. I have decided to follow the Odin project and also my previous learning notes on Django to continue my progress. Coupled with some other courses I have saved already. At the end of this challenge I aim to be a better and stronger full-stack developer.

### Day 2: May 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've made progress with my Django refresher.

**Thoughts** Today I was able to make significant progress in my refresher of the Django framework. I am using my notes from 2022 and I'm impressed with our detailed my notes were. If only I did notes for others like I did for Django haha. I was able to cover views, urls, models, templates and forms with django. This time around using the Django docs for references to what I don't understand or what I want to get more understanding on. I've gotten a hang of Django's template filters too and saved down resources for it.


### Day 2: May 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I started the Odin's project foundations course

**Thoughts** Today I was started the Odin's project foundations course and was able to complete the introduction section. I've joined the Discord server and I'm all ready to go. I went through Bootstrap's documentation to setup parts for My Django project. I went through Django's model documentation to better understand the concept of models
