# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2024

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Starting out with 100 Days of code.

**Thoughts:** Today marks the first day of the challenge and I so hope to see it to the end. I have decided to follow the Odin project and also my previous learning notes on Django to continue my progress. Coupled with some other courses I have saved already. At the end of this challenge I aim to be a better and stronger full-stack developer.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
