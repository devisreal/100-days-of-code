<!-- ### Day 1: May 2, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've made progress with my Django refresher.

**Thoughts** Today I was able to make significant progress in my refresher of the Django framework. I am using my notes from 2022 and I'm impressed with our detailed my notes were. If only I did notes for others like I did for Django haha. I was able to cover views, urls, models, templates and forms with django. This time around using the Django docs for references to what I don't understand or what I want to get more understanding on. I've gotten a hang of Django's template filters too and saved down resources for it.
